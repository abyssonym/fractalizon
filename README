--- HOW TO USE ---
    Running the randomizer:
        Windows users may use the executable file, "twewy_fractalizon.exe". Other users, please run "randomizer.py" using Python version 3.8+.

    Compatible with the following roms for NDS:
        TWEWY_NA    3bfc95753b37c97a6d30018630048a51
        TWEWY_JP    8c2f434ae2ae92c4f0e801eee670063c

    This randomizer has the following flags:
        a  Randomize threads abilities.
        b  Randomize shop stocks and brands.
        d  Randomize enemy drops.
        f  Randomize food.
        t  Randomize threads stats.
        v  Randomize nothing.

    Additionally, the level of randomness can be adjusted to your preference. A value of 0 changes virtually nothing, a value of 1 is extremely unbalanced (i.e., final boss stats on day 1), and 0.5 is the recommended, default setting.
